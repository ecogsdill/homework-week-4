#* You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data. 


1.) There are both a lot more males than females who make purchases in this game (although we don't 
know what percentage they represent of all PLAYERS in the game, assuming it is free-to-play) AND
the males who make purchases are generally more lucrative customers. They purchase more expensive items on average,
 and tend to spend more money in total on average as well (per the Normalized Total).

 2.) There isn't a huge amount of variability in the total number of items that individual users purchase. One user
 purchased 5 items, while two users tied with 4 items each and then a ton of users purchased 3 items total (you
 can see that if you pull the top 10 instead of the top 5 users by total count of items purchased). However, there is
 considerable variability in total amount purchased, with the top spender spending over 5 times as much as the average
 user. The top 5 total spenders also tended to purchase more expensive items on average than all of the users.

 3.) The most profitable items are a bit less popular than the most popular items. However, their higher average purchase
 price more than makes up for the fact that users are buying fewer of them. This causes a substantial difference in
 the overall profitability of the most popular vs the most profitable items - there isn't a single item in common
 among both of those top 5 lists.
